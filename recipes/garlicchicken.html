    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This actually uses my breading for Chicken Fried Steak---my husband suggested we try it with chicken breasts, and it was delicious!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>step 1 In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg.</li>
        <li>step 2 Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated.</li>
    </ul>
